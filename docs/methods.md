# Methods
We have investigated whether, during driving, an adaptive automation system can stabilize mental workload and lead to better driving or secondary task performance. To that end, we have adapted the ACT-R driving simulation made by Salvucci (2006) to allow for human user input. We kept the ACT-R model within the program, as it provided a ready-to-use autonomous driving system, the output of which could be used to assist our driving participants.

The driving experiment contained two experimental within-subjects conditions: aided and unaided. In the aided condition the adaptive automation system was enabled, while in the unaided condition the driver remained in full control of the vehicle. For every condition, participants performed a 10-minute driving session. 

Additionally, we manipulated the mental workload on the driver in both conditions to test whether the adaptive automation system took over control in appropriate moments, as well as how the increase in automation would impact the driver. We manipulated the workload with a secondary task, namely solving multiplication problems. These problems consisted of multiplying two numbers that could each range from 10 up to and including 21. The problems were presented to the participants aurally, with a text-to-speech synthesizer, rather than visually; this allowed participants to keep watching the road, which in turn allowed us to continue to monitor changes in their pupil size. Participants were instructed to respond to the problems with their voice. To create distinct switches between light and heavy mental workload, periods in which the participants were required to perform the secondary task alternated with periods within which they could focus solely on driving. Specifically, every condition session contained two 2.5-minute periods without a secondary task, and two 2.5-minute periods with a secondary task (see Figure X).

To prevent any effect of specific multiplication problems on pupil size and/or driving performance, two different lists of multiplication problems will be created and counterbalanced across the participants. Similarly, to prevent any learning effects, we will also have to counterbalance the aided/unaided conditions across participants. This yields 2*2=4 different experiment run configurations, as detailed in the table below. This means that we will recruit a number of participants dividable by four, so every configuration will be associated with the same number of participants.

| Session 1 (automation condition) | Session 2 (automation condition) | Session 1 (multiplication list) | Session 2 (multiplication list) |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Aided                            | Unaided                          | List 1                          | List 2                          |
| Aided                            | Unaided                          | List 2                          | List 1                          |
| Unaided                          | Aided                            | List 1                          | List 2                          |
| Unaided                          | Aided                            | List 2                          | List 1                          |
